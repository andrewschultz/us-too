# Us Too (IFComp 2025 entrant)

IFComp 2025 Entrant.

This is a repository for the Inform 7 source code for *Us Too*, which was submitted to [IFComp 2025](https://ifcomp.org). The deadline was August 28, 2025, and the initial release was September 1, 2025.

Us Too uses the same mechanics as [Why Pout](https://github.com/andrewschultz/why-pout), my 2024 IFComp entrant. A runnable web version is [here](https://andrewschultz.itch.io/quirky-test), with a downloadable HTML file, and with individual files more easily downloadable.

## Game Details

*Us Too* is a wordplay game which requires you to find two-word phrases. It has 64 core points, 5 bonus points, and 29 rooms.

## Walkthroughs and maps

There is a general game map.

The walkthrough.txt file will guide you through how to get all the bonus points and footnotes. There are seventeen of each. I imagine that should be enough for most players.

The achievements are optional and are meant to be a bit tricky. It's possible to get them all in two trips through, but I have to admit, the effort wasn't trivial for me to organize things, and I programmed the game!

If you want to, you can see the way through in achievements.txt.
