# test ending stuff everywhere
Would you like to
by a point

Would you like to RESTART, RESTORE a saved game, QUIT, UNDO the last command or see points MISSED?

>missed
This list will spell out the solutions (except for the pawn) if you type MISSED again:
--The lucent row could be changed.
--The mess kit let you do something silly.
--There was an optional food item in Pea Stalks.
--You could've acted on the pun tweaker's pun churn after getting rid of Sir Freddie (must restart to achieve).
--Turbo Tours could've used a rebrand.
    (BLAH COUGH will open any blocked-off area you need to visit.)
There's a way besides DROP to dismiss the war pawn, when unused, to get a bonus point, if you observe and understand it carefully.

>missed
Here are the specific commands you missed:
--You could've made a LOOSE INTRO fall from the lucent row in My New Mine, Ooh!.
--You could've performed a MEH SKIT once you uncovered the mess pot/kit.
--You could've discovered a PEA POD in Pea Stalks when you wondered if you could peep odd things, for a bit more food.
--You could've asked for a PUNCH URN around the pun tweaker's pun churn (must restart to achieve).
--You could've made Turbo Tours more relaxed by renaming it TOUR BOATERS.
    (BLAH COUGH will open any blocked-off area you need to visit.)
