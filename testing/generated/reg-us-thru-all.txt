Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh has nothing special in it.
You have that too-rad tour ad flopping about, too. It seems non-critical. You can probably examine and then drop it.
Note that X will default to 'Aight, Amusing Item Using in the future.

It's a recipe, actually.
It's a list of all the things Aunt Rickie-Anne said you need to provide a feast.
You haven't found any yet, so I didn't sort them into have and don't have.
-- some munchies (the kind is not specified. What's up with that?)
-- cookware
-- seasoning
-- eggs
-- crust
-- a variety of alcoholic drinks
-- a variety of meats
-- more than one type of bread
-- hand protection from the heat
-- nonalcoholic refreshment
-- well, just all sorts of fruits and vegetables

You walk towards the black ops site, but you're flagged down. What are you doing here? How did you even get close? After some questioning, you're sent back to the Ur-Branch by people who "suggest" you forget this ever happened. Returning is ... not advised.

>blah copse
by a point

Aha! That was what you were doing wrong. You just needed to tweak a thing or two as you walked north. This time, you avoid the black-ops site. Once you see the path, well, it's hard to un-see.
