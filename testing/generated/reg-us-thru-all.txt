Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh has nothing special in it.
A'ight, Amusing Item Using, which you got to start, lists items Aunt Rickie-Anne asked for. You don't have any yet.
You have that Urge-Ought-'Er Jot flopping about, too. It probably only had stuff to help you get started, which might help you figure how to get going.
For future reference, X will default to A'ight, Amusing Item Using in the future. It will be about as helpful to you as I/INVENTORY.

Yes, yes. That's what really matters. Your quest.

You manage to stand up to the beast a bit. It could beat you, sure, but you're not worth the effort. It trudges off, no longer blocking you from leaving. It has easier prey. "Be stranger, beast-ranger," you call out, gaining confidence.

>x

On inspection, you realize A'ight, Amusing Item Using is sort of a recipe, full of food and food preparation items.
It's a list of all the things Aunt Rickie-Anne said you need to provide a feast.
You haven't found any yet, so I didn't sort them into have and don't have.
-- some munchies (the kind is not specified. What's up with that?)
-- cookware
-- seasoning
-- eggs
-- crust
-- a variety of alcoholic drinks
-- a variety of meats
-- more than one type of bread
-- hand protection from the heat
-- nonalcoholic refreshment
-- well, just all sorts of fruits and vegetables

A loose intro flutters down from the lucent row. You pick it up. As you do, the lucent row stops glowing and becomes a ledge. A Goal-Edge-Go Ledge, to be precise.
!But then the Goal-Edge-Go Ledge, containing nothing, retracts after a bit. Well, you got everything you could want from it.

>x intro
It's an introduction to your world, not from Aunt Rickie-Anne, but from one Hugh Morris AKA Mick Stupp. Before reading the intro proper, you note a small warning that while no puzzles are spoiled or hinted, the author does discuss his views on how Us Too compares to Why Pout (length, plot, etc.) and also mentions how two or three puzzles break the mold a bit.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-1
>x intro
There's a brief explanation about how Us Too reuses a lot of the code from Why Pout, though hopefully the different stories and puzzles give enough variety to keep you interested. Both are polite on the Zarfian cruelty scale, so there's no way to die.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-2
>x intro
Us Too has 29 rooms which can be placed in a 5x6 map--well, one pair of rooms in the code actually functions as "two rooms below a certain room," and I don't count the initial room in the map. A map comes with the game, but location names may spoil puzzles. (On the other hand, they may help you look ahead if you want.) It has a basic hub location where you slowly discover other passages. There are thirteen total, not including back down.
For reference, the House would be the northeast corner, with the Mine to the left, and the hub room just after the mine two southwest of the House.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-3
>x intro
For those who played Why Pout, you won't have companions, but you will have NPCs to deal with, hostile and friendly.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-4
>x intro
Us Too has more points than Why Pout, but I hope the points are more intuitive than Why Pout. You should get a few in bunches, which may seem too easy, but there are fewer you have to wait to get.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-5
>x intro
Us Too also has a few puzzles where you have to go beyond the physical description. There'll be a clue that it implies something else, e.g. "What do these words mean?" But I hope it adds variety once you've offered the main mechanic.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-6
>x intro
Us Too also has a puzzle where one direction leads to different rooms.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-7
>x intro
Us Too felt a bit more rushed than Why Pout -- I spent early 2025 writing my first Adventuron game, which took more out of me than was expected, but it was worth it. Then I decided to get a head start on an EctoComp entry. So I'm not as happy with the story, and I'm worried about specific game polish, but on the other hand, I was able to spruce up some features from Why Pout and include some I didn't have the time for, which will work both here and in Why Pout.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-8
>x intro
Us Too has more four-word things you don't need to do anything with but hopefully just laugh at. I piled up a bunch of good examples, and as I let them sit, some started to stand out as "Hey, this is worth putting in."

>herb ranch

#testcase-check-pre-herb-ranch-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-herb-ranch-rule-default
You find a path to a herb ranch. Of course every stew needs herbs. The farmer there gives you a sample saying "Some herb, eh?" The phrase sticks with you as conversation continues.
It's a surprisingly enlightening one. What can you do with it?

>summer bay
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-summer-bay-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-summer-bay-rule-default
The herb gives off a weird ... well, not quite a smell. But it opens your mind to new passages, passages that might actually lead somewhere, without having to light it or do anything adults who drank a lot told you was very, very dangerous.
Your newly opened mind discerns a safe passage east. Hey, that's a start!

#testcase-check-pre-be-chill-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-be-chill-rule-default
Your general sense of malaise disperses, which makes you more observant. Observant enough to notice a nigh swarm which ... keeps things from being perfect.

>nice warm

#testcase-check-pre-nice-warm-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-nice-warm-rule-default
The nigh swarm grows less volatile and, yes, more nice, warm. It rises in the air, then buzzes off to somewhere to maybe be nice, cool, too. Perhaps there is a nigh school!
Behind where the swarm was, a pro ball has rolled into view. You're not sure what sport it could be for, but it's marked PRO.

>probe all
by a point

#testcase-check-pre-probe-all-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-probe-all-rule-default
You reach out to the pro ball. The PRO painted on it slowly dissolves. You take it, then look at it from many different angles. It's still very cloudy, but you start to see a map of where you are and where you've been. Reflected in one shiny corner, corresponding to in My New Mine, Ooh!, you see ... well, a meh spot that could use sprucing up. But how?
That seems useful, though. Perhaps it will become less cloudy as you need it.
As you stare a bit more, you think you see an isle to the east of here, too. You spend time wondering how to get there, and when you look up, you notice some sort of ship. You wave, and someone on it waves back. They introduce themselves as the Pun Tweaker. Their ship is the Gauche/Hip GO-Ship. They explain it needs repairs and then immediately start in with some crunching puns involving "ship-shape" and other phrases that I won't repeat, because man, they are distressing. Unfortunately, given some of the stuff you had to envision to get here, and what you expect you'll need to do, you can't really retaliate, but nothing's TOO terrible.
[NOTE: the pro ball will open passages of its own accord for a while. You'll never need to examine it explicitly to open new ones, but it will help you with a complex map near the end.]

Consulting with the pro ball, you eventually learn to understand how it displays things and, yes, you find that mess pot! You're a bit worried it might be THAT kind of mess pot, but no. It's cookware. Not just a mess pot, in fact, but a whole mess kit!
But it's not just about finding a mess kit. It's about the process! You feel like you could use it better now aboveground.

Since it wasn't hard to find, you don't feel excited you found it, but you carry it anyway. Thankfully, nobody in the maul tower gaffles or arrests you for stealing.

You walk north, but somehow, you stumble by a black ops site, and you're flagged down. What are you doing here? How did you even get close? After some questioning, you're sent back to the Ur-Branch by people who "suggest" you forget this ever happened. Returning is ... not advised.

You reject the Forest Team for Esteem's jibes consistently and forcefully, not worrying about intellectual rigor. They give up on you. Someone else appears, relieved you got rid of them. He introduces himself as Sir Freddie. He thinks perhaps they are right, and he is not cut out for quests.
[NOTE: if you wish, you can refer to him as F or Sir F.]

>surf ready

Sir Freddie agrees with you, but he doesn't know how to get started. You have just the thing! Your red board is kind of bulky but not heavy. It'd be nice not to have to carry it around. He waves. "See you later. Oh, one other thing... I think I heard an orc lurk to the north. Another reason to give up this questing."

Haha! Sir Freddie seemed nice enough, but you guess he was scared of someone else who was scared and putting up a front. Sure enough, a clerk Sir Freddie could've beaten up with one hand (if Sir Freddie had the courage to fight, of course) comes out of a bunker with their hands up. They begin to apologize, but you say it's all right.
"You ... you aren't part of the forest team?" Certainly not, you assure them.
"That's a relief! I wish I had more to give you than this blah string I found. I have no clue what to do with it. Oh, and I should never have meddled with what's to the north ... but maybe you can ..."
With that, the clerk runs away, turning briefly to wave at you.

You decide the direct way of climbing the pile at a steep angle just won't work. But it's a big pile, and as you walk around, you see a slower way, less steep, but less likely to cause you to slip. You get to the top and have a look around. From your vantage point, you see a new path from the Ur-Branch, to the southwest! You also see places well beyond it, to the west and south. Well, that should cover all the directions.
It makes you almost forget about the high cup. Well, it turns out the high cup is glued to other trash. Dang it! You're not sure if you needed it, anyway. It looks a bit too fancy for whatever you want to prepare.

The feeling of cleverness lasts only a few seconds, though. You realize how you could've seen it sooner if you'd been paying attention. After fifteen minutes, you feel even less clever for having spent fifteen minutes unconstructively visiting the past.

That does it. They realize you are not to be trifled with, and some of your puns were actually pretty good. Their branches and leaves blow in the wind, beckoning you south. You start, then gasp "ouch." What the heck?! They were fibbing.

The scribes get together and nod their heads. They agree this must be it. Your request is a wise choice, one not motivated by greed. They give you a rag and a surprisingly modern squirt-bottle full of cleaning liquid, and the rust from the bell flakes off to form a belt. It becomes much shinier. And perhaps ... well, this belt, rusted, was something much more once. Perhaps you are the one to return it to its former questing glory. Such things do not interest scribes. They move the bell back to the out-of-sight (it really IS quite a work of architecture) bell tower from whence it came.

You have a think. It's not terrible. You've gotten here. You can get back. You really did trample through whatever was to the east. You walk off the ankle sprain you get from falling down. As you do, you notice passages west and north -- a bit hidden, but actually a bit more obvious than the way back east. Wow! The things you notice once you take a deep breath and try to gain perspective!

You have a business idea! You explain it to the folks at Turbo Tours. They play it down, but of course, after a bit they implement it and it works well and they take credit for it.
That's sort of a bummer, but you are glad to have made the area a bit more accessible to less aggressive tourists.

#testcase-check-pre-stark-raft-rule-fallthrough
#testcase-run-post-stark-raft-rule-default
You let slip that perhaps a stark raft is more in your price range. A voice from behind the star craft agrees. They, in fact, have a particularly plain one which has been not at all good for business. They're willing to give it to you, if you promise not to loiter too much. Thus, they redirect you away to a new area of Turbo Tours, one without the star craft, and tell you the "budget" vacation is a rustic isle just south. Not at all crowded with tourists!
You feel belittled, but hey, a free raft is a free raft. Your prime oar should work just fine on it. You quickly run back to the beach to get it, then return and fit it to the raft.

You have no idea whether to call a bear or even if it's a good idea. But you find a honeycomb high up in a tree. It's too high up for you, even when you return with the prime oar, which will maybe be useful if things get violent.
You wave the oar around the tree, hoping to catch a bear's attention. The bear nods at you as if to say "Huh, Neatest Honey Test!" You hand it the prime oar, and it swats down the honeycomb, which it takes. But it provides you with a variety of berries in payment for saving it the effort with the oar. Then it lifts up a paw. You are on its territory. It would not do to stay. You have gotten what you want, and it is time to go. So you do.

Of course it makes sense there'd be a barn on farm isles. You visit the barn. Inside it are some truly glorious eggs! Of course, they are not for free, but you have plenty of extra berries. The farmer thanks you--picking berries to the south is so treacherous--and hands you the very best egg. It's an egg of a GUV'!

Yes, that's what to do. You consider ordering, but what can you pay with? You have nothing too valuable, or so it seems.
But wait! The fey loners/fail-owners spy the Terra Blade on you. You start mumbling surely it can't be used for something so pedestrian ... but perhaps it, or the spirit in it, is sick of saving the world and stuff. "Beef rended: befriended!" the fey loners/fail-owners exclaim, as they hand you a full variety platter: a me-track-meat rack!

"Oh! We almost forgot! Business is booming so much, we might even start selling ice cream. You've earned a little something. Maybe this will come in handy for you. We don't need any repairs at the moment, and if we did, we'd need a different tool." They hand you some "Mope, Liars, Mo'" Pliers.

You realize which node to hack up. You realise what to say. The "Mope, Liars, Mo'" Pliers do their work on node eight. "Imminent destruction?" you scoff. "NO DATE!"
You hear a FIZZ, then a BOOM ... the explosion knocks you back. Boy! It's a good thing you were still wearing those den specs! The pliers fly from your hand and into the specs, which they twist and shatter and blow off your face into a corner. A corner which disappears as the roof starts to collapse. You figure it's a good time to go back to the dell.
There, people start streaming towards you. They lift you up in the air, which is fun for the first fifteen seconds, but you know they mean well. They prove they mean well by handing you a valuable item.
"THE HELP-IN-HELL PIN," one of them booms. You note you haven't come across anything close to hell, so maybe ... well ...
You are cut off again. It will help you in anywhere unusually uncomfortable. Well, it sure can't hurt.
There's not much else to say. You feel a bit awkward. All you can do is tell them to visit the nice cheery new deli just off to the west! That, they do. Hooray, bringing people together!

"Actually," you say, "I just have this list of stuff I needed for a big meal. I've looked everywhere, but I'm still out a ton of vegetables and fruits. I was kinda hoping there'd be at least some fruits here..."
"Um, no, not at all, just didn't want to ask anyone to do too much, here. I mean it might like harm the soil and render it untillable for generations of farmers to come. Or something. Heck. Now I'm sounding basso profundo."
"Your self-awareness is admirable. Yes, we have spare vegetables. They are kind of funny-shaped. Is that a problem? No? Good."
Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh feels like it may burst from the additional weight! Good thing you kept those dense pecs when you made the den specs.

So you make the stew to pass the time until then. You try to avoid thinking of it as my stew, because eww, that'd be a me-ill meal. Our stew might be, too.
You're no natural cook, but you do your best. (You make other random seeming stews over the years, and people always seem to appreciate them, but none quite has the flavor of this one.) After the meal, the announcement -- the mine is yours, and you can sell it now. You wonder if there's anything else, but you don't want to be greedy.
Everyone winds down by playing poker. The lawyers are, unsurprisingly, all quite good at it. Well, you're not playing with real money, so you don't mind losing. The lawyers needle you a bit about losing.
You respond you got enough today, right? I wouldn't want to get greedy.
One of the lawyers chuckles and asks you offhand what you call the stew. Aunt Rickie-Anne surprisingly didn't specify it. You give your answer, and you wonder if maybe there is one more subtle odd test. The lawyers seem to have an inside joke going as your chips dwindle slowly.

You manage to discover a few aces and twos that weren't there, when you need them. You're not sure where they go, or where they came from. But the lawyers catch on, smiling. You start winning, and before it's over, they say "Well done. A little extra for you. Aunt Rickie-Anne had a magic gem, one passed down only to those who were fully worthy. It provided insight into people's hearts."
You ask what it could be.
They show you. You nod politely, saying it's very nice.
"It is a whinge-you'll-win jewel. It causes greedy people to overreact. Some will say they must have it. Some will say they own better jewels. Some will say they deserve it more than So-and-So. Even if they can't see it or ar near it, they will show their seedy side. Some may manage to keep the mask up for a while."
You mention you're not sure you want that kind of power, and they say--well, yes, it's no fun to carry around. But it will be there when you need it. Why, Aunt Rickie-Anne used it to help sort out ... certain family members. Not exclusively. But to confirm her suspicions. For better or worse. You shake hands with the lawyers again, and they leave.
