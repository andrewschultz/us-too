>about
Once you figure what to say to the lawyers (a short phrase with short words,) you will have the opportunity to uncover a small in-game document with my general relatively non-spoilery thoughts on Us Too's design. It's not necessary, of course, but attaining the bonus point may help gear you up for the other puzzles.

>about
The lucent row here contains, if you look at it right, something with more subjective details and opinions. It's a bonus point, but it might help prepare you for the rest of the game.

You haven't examined the Urgh-Ought-'Er Jot yet, though you don't need to, to win the game. Drop it anyway?
Next time, you'll drop it without this nag.

>undo

>x jot
It's a note from Aunt Rickie-Anne: "The items on the row/ledge may help when needed. No shame using them everywhere, and I won't be offended if you find them useless or even drop them. Or drop this, now you've read it. One less thing to worry about in your inventory.
"You can change the row/ledge itself if you want, but you don't need to. Some subjective information about your surroudings. Maybe with experience you'll have an a-ha moment, and you'll see this whole area in a new light.
"You could say it's a welcome of sorts."

>drop jot
You actually just crumple it up and put it in your pocket, in case you need to start a fire later to, I don't know, cook stuff. Plus, littering isn't cool!
The Urgh-Ought-'Er Jot is out of your conscious inventory, now.

You've currently not examined it yet.
Are you sure you want to drop the loose intro? It's not game-critical.
Okay, there will be no nag next time you try to drop the loose intro.

>x intro
It's an introduction to your world, not from Aunt Rickie-Anne, but from one Hugh Morris AKA Mick Stupp. Before reading the intro proper, you note a small warning that while no puzzles are spoiled or hinted, the author does discuss his views on how Us Too compares to Why Pout (length, plot, etc.) and also mentions how two or three puzzles break the mold a bit.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-1
>x intro
There's a brief explanation about how Us Too reuses a lot of the code from Why Pout, though hopefully the different stories and puzzles give enough variety to keep you interested. Both are polite on the Zarfian cruelty scale, so there's no way to die.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-2
>x intro
Us Too has 29 rooms which can be placed in a 5x6 map--well, one pair of rooms in the code actually functions as "two rooms below a certain room," and I don't count the initial room in the map. A map comes with the game, but location names may spoil puzzles. (On the other hand, they may help you look ahead if you want.) It has a basic hub location where you slowly discover other passages. There are thirteen total, not including back down.
For reference, the House would be the northeast corner, with the Mine to the left, and the hub room just after the mine two southwest of the House.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-3
>x intro
For those who played Why Pout, you won't have companions, but you will have NPCs to deal with, hostile and friendly.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-4
>x intro
Us Too has more points than Why Pout, but I hope the points are more intuitive than Why Pout. You should get a few in bunches, which may seem too easy, but there are fewer you have to wait to get.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-5
>x intro
Us Too also has a few puzzles where you have to go beyond the physical description. There'll be a clue that it implies something else, e.g. "What do these words mean?" But I hope it adds variety once you've offered the main mechanic.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-6
>x intro
Us Too also has a puzzle where one direction leads to different rooms.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-7
>x intro
Us Too felt a bit more rushed than Why Pout -- I spent early 2025 writing my first Adventuron game, which took more out of me than was expected, but it was worth it. Then I decided to get a head start on an EctoComp entry. So I'm not as happy with the story, and I'm worried about specific game polish, but on the other hand, I was able to spruce up some features from Why Pout and include some I didn't have the time for, which will work both here and in Why Pout.

#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-8
>x intro
Us Too has more four-word things you don't need to do anything with but hopefully just laugh at. I piled up a bunch of good examples, and as I let them sit, some started to stand out as "Hey, this is worth putting in."

You already discarded the loose intro that discusses design and such for Us Too, so you'll need to restart to read it again.

That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Us Too has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.

***SHORTCUT COMMANDS***
N2 or 2N or NN gets you all the way back north.
"Ugh?! Lo, a Glow": S (command)
Sage Oaks: SS (command)
"Grasp, Ace: Grass" Space: SSS (command)
There's also a note that R cycles/rotates between "Grasp, Ace: Grass" Space, "Ugh?! Lo, a Glow" and Sage Oaks, and RR does the reverse, with no penalty for forgetting the rotation order.

You're trying to rotate to somewhere unvisited. So you may need to go north, then rotate, then go back south. Or you may want to RR instead of R.
