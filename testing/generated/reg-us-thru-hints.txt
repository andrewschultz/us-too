The eyes will light up two sets of dots if there is something you still need to do in the area. (1/6)

>eye eyes
The numbers of dots correspond to the number of letters in the first and second words to type, respectively. (2/6)

The dots also have two different types of appearances that clue you to the puzzle nature: green or yellow, and dimly glowing or glowing. (3/6)

>eye eyes
