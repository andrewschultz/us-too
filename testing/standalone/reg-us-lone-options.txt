You haven't found either option that affects gameplay. One appears when you try to visit blocked-off areas, and one appears when you get each half of a solution right on different occasions. They don't appear at the start because I didn't want to overload you with potentially useless options early on.
However, if you know them from another playthrough, you can use them.

>think well
Revealing commands half-thought two different ways is now on.

>options
You have found/learned of one of two total options:
THINK WELL shows a full point-scoring command if you've guessed each part. THIN QUELL (default) turns it off. This option is currently on.

>be zzz
You're not quite sure how to get started and get focused. There are almost too many possibilities. The help left for you in the mine -- well, that may help make sense of things later. Perhaps examining yourself with X ME or recapping what you know with THINK should come first.

A voice in your head encourages you: "Seem, or see, more!" You've got SOMETHING right, here.
[NOTE: this and other half-right guesses will be tracked in THINK until you figure the right phrase.]

>zzz strong
[NOTE: you've just figured a two-word solution by parts. THINK may refresh your memory.]

>be zzz
[NOTE: you've actually already figured both words before. THINK may refresh your memory.]

>think
You feel you've got the words right on separate occasions for getting rid of the beast.
You can have THINK verify the identity of the separate words with THINK WELL. THIN QUELL turns the option off.

You try and think of stuff you tried, but the time wasn't quite right, or maybe you only figured it half-way.

You've tried to go back somewhere you don't need to, so it's blocked by default. BLAH COUGH allows you to ignore such barriers here, and BLOCK OFF blocks you again. These two commands will be listed in OPTIONS.
