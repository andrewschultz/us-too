The war pawn wags its finger, then points its finger at you, at its eyes, and at you again. Sounds like a suggestion to X ME before using the pawn. Well, it's good to know where to start.

>{include}_part2

>x pawn
It's a grey chess pawn. It's currently alert, with a frown and mean glare carved in the rounded top. Unlike most pawns, it has fists, doubled up in a fighting posture.
Looking at it from many different angles gets you all sorts of weird ideas. Perhaps it could help you when you run out of them on your quest. You may wish to wait until you really need to use it, though of course, you don't want to wait too late.
If you want to resist the temptation of this cheat item, DROP it. There is no penalty for using it.
If you wish to understand the mechanics of the war pawn, KNOW PAWN. (This command will be in VERBS if you forget.)
Oh, yes, you can't just USE the war pawn. You need a specific command, one in the spirit of Us Too.

>warp on
After some thought, the war pawn vibrates and gestures wildly! You suddenly have insight into a good way forward: SUMMER BAY...
The herb gives off a weird ... well, not quite a smell. But it opens your mind to new passages, passages that might actually lead somewhere, without having to light it or do anything adults who drank a lot told you was very, very dangerous.

Your newly opened mind discerns a safe passage east. Hey, that's a start!

The war pawn curls up and goes to sleep after all that excitement. It needs some time to recover.

>undo
Allowing you to undo using the war pawn is a bit too much of a loophole. There's a walkthrough. Or you can save and restore a lot before warping.

>x pawn
It's a grey chess pawn. It's currently sleeping from previous use.

After some thought, the war pawn vibrates and gestures wildly! You suddenly have insight into a good way forward: BARN OPEN...
The war pawn shrugs its shoulders, holds up the number three, waves, and runs off, making occasional diagonal jumps at unseen prey.

>x pawn
Nothing (significant) here like that. Note that while you may need to act on room names, X/EYE (THIS ROOM'S NAME) is often not implemented because L or LOOK takes less characters to type.
