Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh has nothing special in it.
A'ight, Amusing Item Using, which you got to start, lists items Aunt Rickie-Anne asked for. You don't have any yet.
You have that Urgh-Ought-'Er Jot flopping about, too. It probably only had stuff to help you get started, which might help you figure how to get going.
For future reference, X will default to A'ight, Amusing Item Using in the future. It will be about as helpful to you as I/INVENTORY.
