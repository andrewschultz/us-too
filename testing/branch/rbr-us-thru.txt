##--stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
##--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$ONEWORD=A voice in your head encourages you: "Seem, or see, more!" You've got SOMETHING right, here.
}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Us Too has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
}$REJHOM=Hmm. That really, really SOUNDED like it should work, but it didn't.
}$XTRA=The first word was a valid command that could stand on its own. The second may be unnecessary, or a typo.
}$EYEITMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to do anything with
}$EYEITMDONE=The eyes show nothing. You've done everything you need with
}$EYERMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to do anything with the general area, though specific things may provide a clue.
}$EYERMDONE=The eyes show nothing. You've done everything you need with the general area, though specific things may provide a clue.

You have that too-rad tour ad flopping about, too. It seems non-critical. You can probably examine and then drop it.

It's a recipe, actually.
It's a list of all the things Aunt Rickie-Anne said you need to provide a feast.
You haven't found any yet, so I didn't sort them into have and don't have.
-- some munchies (the kind is not specified. What's up with that?)
-- cookware
-- seasoning
-- eggs
-- crust
-- a variety of alcoholic drinks
-- a variety of meats
-- more than one type of bread
-- hand protection from the heat
-- nonalcoholic refreshment
-- well, just all sorts of fruits and vegetables

You walk north, but somehow, you stumble by a black ops site, and you're flagged down. What are you doing here? How did you even get close? After some questioning, you're sent back to the Ur-Branch by people who "suggest" you forget this ever happened. Returning is ... not advised.

Aha! That was what you were doing wrong. You just needed to tweak a thing or two as you walked north. This time, you avoid the black-ops site. Once you see the path, well, it's hard to un-see.
