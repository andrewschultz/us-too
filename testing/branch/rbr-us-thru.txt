##--stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
##--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

#copied from WP. Change later.
}$ONEWORD=A voice in your head encourages you: "Seem, or see, more!" You've got SOMETHING right, here.
}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Us Too has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
}$REJHOM=Hmm. That really, really SOUNDED like it should work, but it didn't.
}$XTRA=The first word was a valid command that could stand on its own. The second may be unnecessary, or a typo.

It's a recipe, actually.
It's a list of all the things Aunt Rickie-Anne said you need to provide a feast.
You haven't found any yet, so I didn't sort them into have and don't have.
-- some munchies (the kind is not specified. What's up with that?)
-- cookware
-- seasoning
-- eggs
-- crust
-- a variety of alcoholic drinks
-- a variety of meats
-- more than one type of bread
-- hand protection from the heat
-- nonalcoholic refreshment
-- well, just all sorts of fruits and vegetables
