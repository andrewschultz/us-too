##--stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
##--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$ONEWORD=A voice in your head encourages you: "Seem, or see, more!" You've got SOMETHING right, here.
}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Us Too has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
}$REJHOM=Hmm. That really, really SOUNDED like it should work, but it didn't.
}$XTRA=The first word was a valid command that could stand on its own. The second may be unnecessary, or a typo.
}$EYEITMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to change up anything with
}$EYEITMDONE=The eyes show nothing. You've changed up everything you need with
}$EYERMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to do anything with the general area, though specific things may provide a clue.
}$NOTHEREHINT=Nothing (significant) here like that. (Once-per-room reminder:) while you may need to act on room names, X/EYE (THIS ROOM'S NAME) is often not implemented because L/EYE without a subject takes less characters to type.
}$NOTHEREHINT2=Nothing (significant) here like that.\n!reminder
Nothing (significant) here like that. Note that while you may need to act on room names, X (THIS ROOM'S NAME) is often not implemented because EYE without a subject for the room, or to see what needs changing in the room takes less characters to type.
}$NOTHERE=Nothing (significant) here like that.
}$EYESWANDER0=Nothing for the general area, and the sly size-slice eyes don't point to any individual item.
}$EYESWANDER1=The eyes see nothing in the general area but seem to be wandering to 
}$EYESWANDER2=Nothing for the general area, though the sly size-slice eyes seem to wander between

Once you figure what to say to the lawyers (a short phrase with short words,) you will have the opportunity to uncover a small in-game document with my general relatively non-spoilery thoughts on Us Too's design. It's not necessary, of course, but attaining the bonus point may help gear you up for the other puzzles.

Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh has nothing special in it.
A'ight, Amusing Item Using, which you got to start, lists items Aunt Rickie-Anne asked for. You don't have any yet.
#OK-APOSTROPHE
You have that Urgh-Ought-'Er Jot flopping about, too. It probably only had stuff to help you get started, which might help you figure how to get going.
For future reference, X will default to A'ight, Amusing Item Using in the future. It will be about as helpful to you as I/INVENTORY.

You manage to stand up to the beast a bit. It could beat you, sure, but you're not worth the effort. It trudges off, no longer blocking you from leaving. It has easier prey. "Be stranger, beast-ranger," you call out, gaining confidence.

Nothing (significant) here like that. Note that while you may need to act on room names, X/EYE (THIS ROOM'S NAME) is often not implemented because L/EYE without a subject takes less characters to type.

On inspection, you realize A'ight, Amusing Item Using is sort of a recipe, full of food and food preparation items.
It's a list of all the things Aunt Rickie-Anne said you need to provide a feast.
You haven't found any yet, so I didn't sort them into have and don't have.
-- some munchies (the kind is not specified. What's up with that?)
-- cookware
-- seasoning
-- eggs
-- crust
-- a variety of alcoholic drinks
-- a variety of meats
-- more than one type of bread
-- hand protection from the heat
-- nonalcoholic refreshment
-- well, just all sorts of fruits and vegetables

It's an introduction to your world, not from Aunt Rickie-Anne, but from one Hugh Morris AKA Mick Stupp. Before reading the intro proper, you note a small warning that while no puzzles are spoiled or hinted, the author does discuss his views on how Us Too compares to Why Pout (length, plot, etc.) and also mentions how two or three puzzles break the mold a bit.
\\
#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-1
>x intro
There's a brief explanation about how Us Too reuses a lot of the code from Why Pout, though hopefully the different stories and puzzles give enough variety to keep you interested. Both are polite on the Zarfian cruelty scale, so there's no way to die.
\\
#testcase-x-intro-table-of-intro-jabber-2
>x intro
Us Too has 29 rooms which can be placed in a 5x6 map--well, one pair of rooms in the code actually functions as "two rooms below a certain room," and I don't count the initial room in the map. A map comes with the game, but location names may spoil puzzles. (On the other hand, they may help you look ahead if you want.) It has a basic hub location where you slowly discover other passages. There are thirteen total, not including back down.
For reference, the House would be the northeast corner, with the Mine to the left, and the hub room just after the mine two southwest of the House.

Us Too felt a bit more rushed than Why Pout -- I spent early 2025 writing my first Adventuron game, which took more out of me than was expected, but it was worth it. Then I decided to get a head start on an EctoComp entry. So I'm not as happy with the story, and I'm worried about specific game polish, but on the other hand, I was able to spruce up some features from Why Pout and include some I didn't have the time for, which will work both here and in Why Pout.

You reach out to the pro ball. The PRO painted on it slowly dissolves. You take it, then look at it from many different angles. It's still very cloudy, but you start to see a map of where you are and where you've been. Reflected in one shiny corner, corresponding to in My New Mine, Ooh!, you see ... well, a meh spot that could use sprucing up. But how?
That seems useful, though. Perhaps it will become less cloudy as you need it.
As you stare a bit more, you think you see an isle to the east of here, too. You spend time wondering how to get there, and when you look up, you notice some sort of ship. You wave, and someone on it waves back. They introduce themselves as the Pun Tweaker. Their ship is the Gauche/Hip GO-Ship. They explain it needs repairs and then immediately start in with some crunching puns involving "ship-shape" and other phrases that I won't repeat, because man, they are distressing. Unfortunately, given some of the stuff you had to envision to get here, and what you expect you'll need to do, you can't really retaliate, but nothing's TOO terrible.
[NOTE: the pro ball will open passages of its own accord for a while. You'll never need to examine it explicitly to open new ones, but it will help you with a complex map near the end.]

Sure enough, a clerk Sir Freddie could've beaten up with one hand (if Sir Freddie had the courage to fight, of course) comes out of a bunker with their hands up. They begin to apologize, but you say it's all right.
"You ... you aren't part of the forest team?" Certainly not, you assure them.
"That's a relief! I wish I had more to give you than this blah string I found. I have no clue what to do with it. Oh, and I should never have meddled with what's to the north ... but maybe you can ..."

You feel you can take the aching. It takes a bit of time, even though your proposed solution feels a bit glib and simplistic, and you worry a worse aching may replace it ... and, in a way, it does.

You decide the direct way of climbing the pile at a steep angle just won't work. But it's a big pile, and as you walk around, you see a slower way, less steep, but less likely to cause you to slip. You get to the top and have a look around. From your vantage point, you see a new path from the Ur-Branch, to the southwest! You also see places well beyond it, to the west and south. Well, that should cover all the directions.
It makes you almost forget about the high cup. Well, it turns out the high cup is glued to other trash. Dang it! You're not sure if you needed it, anyway. It looks a bit too fancy for whatever you want to prepare.

You think and think and think. Of course, they wouldn't want any old fool pulling the lever. So there's no obvious way to pull it. You try a hundred different ways, then feel clever on the hundred and first when -- CLICK -- it flips, revealing a compartment behind!
The feeling of cleverness lasts only a few seconds, though. You realize how you could've seen it sooner if you'd been paying attention. After fifteen minutes, you feel even less clever for having spent fifteen minutes unconstructively visiting the past.
Then you notice what the lever was hiding: a be-quick beak/wick! Nice if you need speed, you're sure.

"Eh, jokes age oaks," they mutter at first. But they get into it more. They warn you of the trouble you'll get in if you keep telling corny jokes. It doesn't show you're smart. But then you explain you carefully crafted said jokes to peeve them so they give up and let you by because dealing with you isn't worth it. You've had experience all game with wordplay, too. You mention you've just chatted with the pun tweaker.
That does it. They realize you are not to be trifled with, and some of your puns were actually pretty good. Their branches and leaves blow in the wind, beckoning you south. You start, then gasp "ouch." What the heck?! They were fibbing.
The sage oaks laugh a bit. "Just a bit of revenge for those painful jokes," they say, "nothing permanent. We never said we'd give painless passage south. It will be for your own good in the long term. Just a bit of hazing."

The sage oaks chuckle. And you chuckle a bit, too. Turnabout is fair play! They release the gas from the pouch all at once -- of course, not in your direction. "It can hold liquid, too," they say. "But one more thing. Do you know where we got this from?"
You shake your head.
"The Grove Ouch-Grow-Vouch."
Well, you had to figure they had one or two zingers left.

The scribes get together and nod their heads. They agree this must be it. Your request is a wise choice, one not motivated by greed. They give you a rag and a surprisingly modern squirt-bottle full of cleaning liquid, and the rust from the bell flakes off to form a belt. It becomes much shinier. And perhaps ... well, this belt, rusted, was something much more once. Perhaps you are the one to return it to its former questing glory. Such things do not interest scribes. They move the bell back to the out-of-sight (it really IS quite a work of architecture) bell tower from whence it came.

You let slip that perhaps a stark raft is more in your price range. A voice from behind the star craft agrees. They, in fact, have a particularly plain one which has been not at all good for business. They're willing to give it to you, if you promise not to loiter too much. Thus, they redirect you away to a new area of Turbo Tours, one without the star craft, and tell you the "budget" vacation is a rustic isle just south. Not at all crowded with tourists!
You feel belittled, but hey, a free raft is a free raft. Your prime oar should work just fine on it. You quickly run back to the beach to get it, then return and fit it to the raft.

You have no idea whether to call a bear or even if it's a good idea. But you find a honeycomb high up in a tree. It's too high up for you, even when you return with the prime oar, which will maybe be useful if things get violent.
You wave the oar around the tree, hoping to catch a bear's attention. The bear nods at you as if to say "Huh, Neatest Honey Test!" You hand it the prime oar, and it swats down the honeycomb, which it takes. But it provides you with a variety of berries in payment for saving it the effort with the oar. Then it lifts up a paw. You are on its territory. It would not do to stay. You have gotten what you want, and it is time to go. So you do.

The groan odes retract, as nodes grow out, creating a more menacing noise. The nodes are numbered, too, from one on quite a while. There are a lot to poke at!

You realize which node to hack up. You realise what to say. The "Mope, Liars, Mo'" Pliers do their work on node eight. "Imminent destruction?" you scoff. "NO DATE!"
You hear a FIZZ, then a BOOM ... the explosion knocks you back. Boy! It's a good thing you were still wearing those den specs! The pliers fly from your hand and into the specs, which they twist and shatter and blow off your face into a corner. A corner which disappears as the roof starts to collapse. You figure it's a good time to go back to the dell.
There, people start streaming towards you. They lift you up in the air, which is fun for the first fifteen seconds, but you know they mean well. They prove they mean well by handing you a valuable item.
"THE HELP-IN-HELL PIN," one of them booms. You note you haven't come across anything close to hell, so maybe ... well ...
You are cut off again. It will help you in anywhere unusually uncomfortable. Well, it sure can't hurt.
There's not much else to say. You feel a bit awkward. All you can do is tell them to visit the nice cheery new deli just off to the west! That, they do. Hooray, bringing people together!

You call out for malt hour, which maybe isn't quite as good as happy hour. Heck, it might even be a chocolate malt and not malt liquor. But you promise liquid refreshment, which you have in spades, and the guardians come down to share it with you. There are fewer guardians than you thought, so you can save some alcohol for later.
You have a good old talk about ... well, everything. You explain your quest, which they actually find kind of cool. They mention they need to sleep off the booze and are glad to let you through to the east.

Defying the throne, you hold the orb and/or band high in the air. It crackles. Energy shoots to the throne, from which emits a loud "NO TERROR?! NOTE: ERROR!!!!!" The orb flies from your hand and towards the throne and explodes. You also feel the help-in-hell pin ripped from you ... it clunks off somewhere forgotten, maybe to help someone who gets in a more serious pickle than you did.
Where the throne once sat, there's now something glistening. "You have freed the life roots," booms a melodramatic voice.

You call out the life roots: "Come on, this is a bit overblown. Do you really need to be all basso profundo?"
To your surprise, they shrivel up. A voice intones: "Congratulations. You have seen through us. So many adventurers would start looking for eternal life, or profiting from this."
"Actually," you say, "I just have this list of stuff I needed for a big meal. I've looked everywhere, but I'm still out a ton of vegetables and fruits. I was kinda hoping there'd be at least some fruits here..."
"Um, no, not at all, just didn't want to ask anyone to do too much, here. I mean it might like harm the soil and render it untillable for generations of farmers to come. Or something. Heck. Now I'm sounding basso profundo."
"Your self-awareness is admirable. Yes, we have spare vegetables. They are kind of funny-shaped. Is that a problem? No? Good."
Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh feels like it may burst from the additional weight! Good thing you kept those dense pecs when you made the den specs.
