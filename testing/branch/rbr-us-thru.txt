##--stable-file: this eventually says that the project is stable, and I shouldn't change the main/minimal file unless I really need to.
##--strict-file: this says that the project requires strict section marking e.g. @all instead of ==t1.

}$ONEWORD=A voice in your head encourages you: "Seem, or see, more!" You've got SOMETHING right, here.
}$REJECT1=You're stuck with what to do right now. Perhaps you can use your senses for clues, or THINK, or look inward, to give you an idea of how to get started. Not just a what, but a how or a why. You can't exactly look outward.
}$REJECT2=That thought/action/observation/request brings up nothing. Us Too has a limited set of verbs, and the main thing is to guess a two-word phrase. To see what verbs are used, try VERBS.
}$REJHOM=Hmm. That really, really SOUNDED like it should work, but it didn't.
}$XTRA=The first word was a valid command that could stand on its own. The second may be unnecessary, or a typo.
}$EYEITMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to do anything with
}$EYEITMDONE=The eyes show nothing. You've done everything you need with
}$EYERMNO=The eyes show nothing. Probably don't need to do anything with the general area, though specific things may provide a clue.

The herb gives off a weird ... well, not quite a smell. But it opens your mind to new passages, passages that might actually lead somewhere, without having to light it or do anything adults who drank a lot told you was very, very dangerous.
Your newly opened mind discerns a safe passage east. Hey, that's a start!

You reach out to the pro ball. It seems to sense what you want it for. You take it, then look at it from many different angles. Reflected in it, you see ... well, a meh spot in My New Mine, Ooh! that could use sprucing up. But how?
Yet much of the pro ball remains cloudy. Perhaps it will reveal what you need, as you need it.
It also reveals something near here. You notice some sort of ship. You wave, and its captain, so to speak, waves back. They introduce themselves as the Pun Tweaker. Their ship is the Gauche/Hip GO-Ship. They immediately start in with some crunching puns.
[NOTE: you don't need to examine the pro ball from here on out for it to open new passages.]

Sure enough, a clerk Sir Freddie could've beaten up with one hand (if Sir Freddie had the courage to fight, of course) comes out of a bunker with their hands up. They begin to apologize, but you say it's all right.
"You ... you aren't part of the forest team?" Certainly not, you assure them.
"That's a relief! I wish I had more to give you than this blah string I found. I have no clue what to do with it. Oh, and I should never have meddled with what's to the north ... but maybe you can ..."

Well, someone must've been able to get through the bay spikes to dump stuff on the pile, you reason. And you discover something -- base pikes, one you wouldn't want to use on any person, but then again, these spikes could hurt someone, so that seems okay.

You decide the direct way of climbing the pile at a steep angle just won't work. But it's a big pile, and as you walk around, you see a slower way, less steep, but less likely to cause you to slip. You get to the top and have a look around. From your vantage point, you see a new path from the Ur-Branch, to the southwest! You also see places well beyond it, to the west and south. Well, that should cover all the directions.
It makes you almost forget about the high cup. Well, it turns out the high cup is glued to other trash. Dang it! You're not sure if you needed it, anyway. It looks a bit too fancy for whatever you want to prepare.

You think and think and think. Of course, they wouldn't want any old fool pulling the lever. So there's no obvious way to pull it. You try a hundred different ways, then feel clever on the hundred and first when -- CLICK -- it flips, revealing a compartment behind!
The feeling of cleverness lasts only a few seconds, though. You realize how you could've seen it sooner if you'd been paying attention. After fifteen minutes, you feel even less clever for having spent fifteen minutes unconstructively visiting the past.
Then you notice what the lever was hiding: a be-quick beak wick! Nice if you need speed, you're sure.

You realize a broom must be here. You trade the damp ink in the gas pouch for it. The scribes are impressed with the ink ... so much, they show you an artifact few get to see. "It is our BELL, TRUSTED. Yet it has some hidden purpose we could not find. Perhaps it will help you. And -- oh, yes -- that broom? Do return it when you're done."

The scribes get together and nod their heads. They agree this must be it. Your request is a wise choice, one not motivated by greed. They give you a rag and a surprisingly modern squirt-bottle full of cleaning liquid, and the rust from the bell flakes off to form a belt. It becomes much shinier. And perhaps ... well, this belt, rusted, was something much more once. Perhaps you are the one to return it to its former questing glory. Such things do not interest scribes. They move the bell back to the out-of-sight (it really IS quite a work of architecture) bell tower from whence it came.

You have a think. It's not terrible. You've gotten here. You can get back. You really did trample through whatever was to the east. You walk off the ankle sprain you get from falling down.

You let slip that perhaps a stark raft is more in your price range. A voice from behind the star craft agrees. They, in fact, have a particularly plain one which has been not at all good for business. They're willing to give it to you, if you promise not to loiter too much. Thus, they redirect you away to a new area of Turbo Tours, one without the star craft. You feel belittled, but hey, a free raft is a free raft. Your prime oar should work just fine on it.

You have no idea whether to call a bear or even if it's a good idea. But you find a honeycomb high up in a tree. It's too high up for you, even when you return with the prime oar, which will maybe be useful if things get violent.
You wave the oar at the tree, then wave it, hoping to catch a bear's attention. The bear nods at you as if to say "Huh, Neatest Honey Test!" You hand it the prime oar, and it swats down the honeycomb, which it takes. But it provides you with a variety of berries in payment. Then it lifts up a paw. You are on its territory. It would not do to stay. You have gotten what you want, and it is time to go. So you do.

You realize which node to hack up. You realise what to say. The "Mope, Liars, Mo'" Pliers do their work on node eight. "Imminent destruction?" you scoff. "NO DATE!"
You hear a FIZZ, then a BOOM ... the explosion knocks you back. Boy! It's a good thing you were still wearing those den specs! Thr pliers fly from your hand and into the specs, which they twist and shatter and blow off your face into a corner. A corner which disappears as the roof starts to collapse. You figure it's a good time to go back to the dell.
There, people start streaming towards you. They lift you up in the air, which is fun for the first fifteen seconds, but you know they mean well. They prove they mean well by handing you a valuable item.
"THE HELP-IN-HELL PIN," one of them booms. You note you haven't come across anything close to hell, so maybe ... well ...
You are cut off again. It will help you in anywhere unusually uncomfortable. Well, it sure can't hurt.
There's not much else to say. You feel a bit awkward. All you can do is tell them to visit the nice cheery new deli just off to the west! That, they do. Hooray, bringing people together!

You call out for malt hour, which maybe isn't quite as good as happy hour. Heck, it might even be a chocolate malt and not malt liquor. But you promise liquid refreshment, which you have in spades, and the guardians come down to share it with you. There are fewer guardians than you thought, so you can save some alcohol for later.
You have a good old talk about ... well, everything. You explain your quest, which they actually find kind of cool. They mention they need to sleep off the booze and are glad to let you through to the east.

With a rumble, the belt and the pro ball come together to form ... an ORB AND/OR BAND! You feel its power. It is not to be used lightly. Also, the gloom in the general area lifts. It feels less dry, and a dew pit appears.

You rest the egg of a guv in the dew pit. Nothing happens, then a rumbling. The egg grows and splits into ten identical, larger eggs ... and not only that, a small cardboard container arises from the dew pit. It's labeled TEN DREGS' TENDER EGGS. You take it. The dew pit grows dull. It's probably served its purpose. In fact, you can't think of anything else to do here. So you return to...

Defying the throne, you hold the orb and/or band high in the air. It crackles. Energy shoots to the throne, from which emits a loud "NO TERROR?! NOTE: ERROR!!!!!" The orb flies from your hand and towards the throne and explodes. You also feel the help-in-hell pin ripped from you ... it clunks off somewhere forgotten, maybe to help someone who gets in a more serious pickle than you did.
Where the throne once sat, there's now something glistening. "You have freed the life roots," booms a melodramatic voice.

You call out the life roots: "Come on, this is a bit overblown. Do you really need to be all basso profundo?"
To your surprise, they shrivel up. A voice intones: "Congratulations. You have seen through us. So many adventurers would start looking for eternal life, or profiting from this."
"Actually," you say, "I just have this list of stuff I needed for a big meal. I've looked everywhere, but I'm still out a ton of vegetables and fruits. I was kinda hoping there'd be at least some fruits here..."
"Um, no, not at all, just didn't want to ask anyone to do too much, here. I mean it might like harm the soil and render it untillable for generations of farmers to come. Or something. Heck. Now I'm sounding basso profundo."
"Your self-awareness is admirable. Yes, we have spare vegetables. They are kind of funny-shaped. Is that a problem? No? Good."
Your Aw-Lug-All-Ugh feels like it may burst from the additional weight! Good thing you kept those dense pecs when you made the den specs.
"But now, this space needs to heal, free of human interference. Even worthy humans." You nod and leave. There can't be much left to do, now.

Place-to-Play Stew
You look at A'ight, Amusing Item Using. You have everything you need, but you don't have, well, a cohesive dish. You remember the lawyers needling you with "us too." Yes, that's what it has to be. You call them and your friends. They're prepared -- the mine is only an hour's drive from the city.
So you make the stew to pass the time until then. You try to avoid thinking of it as my stew, because eww, that'd be a me-ill meal. Our stew might be, too.
You're no natural cook, but you do your best. (You make other random seeming stews over there years, and people always seem to appreciate them, but none quite has the flavor of this one.) After the meal, the announcement -- the mine is yours, and you can sell it now. You wonder if there's anything else, but you don't want to be greedy.
Everyone winds down by playing poker. The lawyers are, unsurprisingly, all quite good at it. Well, you're not playing with real money, so you don't mind losing. You got enough today, right? Someone asks you offhand what you call the stew. Aunt Rickie-Anne surprisingly didn't specify it. You give your answer, and you wonder if maybe there is one more subtle odd test. The lawyers seem to have an inside joke going as they finish the remains of your...
