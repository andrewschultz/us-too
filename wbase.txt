## *NOHEADER
Walkthrough for Us Too by Andrew Schultz

This is a walkthrough based on the author's test scripts. While any one branch from the hub is relatively linear and straightforward, the final two branches are a bit trickier and bigger. The west and south are independent of each other. The west has two branches. The south has three and is most likely the place where you'll get stuck, because you have to do a little more than map things out. If you're stuck there, search for "to recap."

The gimmick/basic mechanic is the same as Why Pout, though the setting is a bit different. You get NPC friends there. Here? No. But you have a list.

@min
This walkthrough neglects all bonus points.
@!
This walkthrough finds all bonus points except the one you get for getting rid of the war pawn right.

In House Well-How-Swell, you hold an envelope saying "House O' --- --."

What is word #1? What is word #2?

That is the mystery which drives the whole game's mechanic.

Aunt Rickie-Anne liked when you said tricky.

Put these together...

> HOW SO (1)

Okay, so you're wondering why you're in the mine. Perhaps the aid roar can help out.

> A DRAWER (1)

There's a standard command that can clue you to a bonus point.

@max
Since you are "Trike" West, this may indicate what to do. You can earn this point at any time.
\\
> TRY QUEST (1)

> I

Now X defaults to your task list, which tells you what you need to get.

> X

Note the task list keeps track of what is newly acquired and sorts items into gotten and not gotten. Some of them are lumped together if they are related, and that will be indicated, too.

You can, at any time, also deal with the lucent row for a bonus point.

> X ROW

You can take or leave the eyes and pawn. The pawn has three charges. KNOW PAWN several times to understand its mechanics fully. EYE EYES does the same for the eyes. This is a walkthrough, so you technically won't need that explanation, or the items themelves. Just know that the war pawn gains extra charges 1/3 and 2/3 of the way through, around 21 and 42 core points earned on your own. (Bonus points don't count!) The pawn also doesn't use a charge if 1) there is a puzzle you don't have the items for yet or 2) the puzzle it would reveal is something you figured a while back before you had the items, but you have them now. It also detects if your current location is not finished with puzzles yet.

Oh, and you can't use the pawn on the first puzzle until you've examined yourself.

You can get a bonus point for poking at the lucent row, too.

@max
> LOOSE INTRO (1)
\\
You can read the intro if you want. It has more qualitative evaluations of Us Too.

> TRY QUEST (1)

Now a beast, wrong, blocks you.

> BE STRONG (1)

Now, if you want, you can start on Item Using and the items it wants.

> I

This creates a useful shortcut.

> X

This will tell you your progress for list items you've found. You can find one out of the box -- it's the "weird, no instructions" one. Let's do that now.

"Some munchies" seems very vague, but in fact, it isn't...

> SUMMON CHEESE (1)

Now you can do something with the Lucent Row. It has hint items. But it has something else...

@max
You can change the Lucent Row. You can even use the eyes to clue it.

> OUT

At the ur-branch, you need to...

> HERB RANCH (1)

"Some herb, eh?" you hear.

> SUMMER BAY (1)

> E

Now you can have a small points rally at Beach, Ill.

> BE CHILL (1)

The nigh swarm.

> NICE WARM (1)

There's a pro ball here, too. It helps you see a bit more.

> PROBE ALL (1)

Later on you'll be able to examine it, but right now it just helps open new areas.

> W

> D

Ah, a meh spot you missed before.

> MESS POT (1)

@max
There's another bonus point here. The mess kit allows...
\\
> MEH SKIT (1)
###skip test checking

> U

Now things really open up--there are three new exits!

> NE

You can't deal with the tower yet. But the bore dread? Yes.

> BOARD RED (1)

> SW

You can't use the next point-scoring command without going north.

> N

Oh no! How to avoid black ops? Somewhere else boring, perhaps?

> BLAH COPSE (1)

This automatically moves you north to the Blah Copse itself.

The Forest Team is annoying, with how they knock you verbally.

> NAH QUEUE (1)

Sir Freddie was hiding from them. Questing's not his thing.

> SURF READY (1)

Note if you didn't get the board, you couldn't help him.

Now he said he sensed an orc lurk ...

> OR CLERK (1)

You can go north now.

> N

Morph lairs.

> MORE FLARES (1)

You're back at Ur-Branch.

> N
> N

A row, plaider, has now appeared.

> ROPE LADDER (1)

Okay, that's the north area taken care of. There's a new area, inside, but you need to get by that garden tree.

> GUARD ENTRY (1)

Chance for a bonus point, too.

> PEACE TALKS (1)

@max
If you look around again, you may notice something in the description. "Peep odd" may sound odd. It can indeed become more normal.
\\
> PEA POD (1)
###skip test checking
@!
There's an odd phrase here in the room description which can net you a bonus point. It's the reason why the branch isn't closed off right away.

> OUT

Let's try the southeast. We can actually take the northwest right now, but the southeast helps with more immediate puzzles.

> SE

A can't-ache blocks you from doing anything else! But once you do, a few things fall in a row.

> CAN TAKE (1)

> GRAY TIN (1)

> DOUGH MAKING (1)

> IN EARNEST (1)

> SE

> IN

> PRY MORE (1)

> OUT

> NW

You're done with the southeast, so it will be blocked off now.

> E

You've brokered a truce between Sir Freddie and the pun tweaker. Now, ask for payment...

> PUNT WEAKER (1)

> E

There's stuff to be found on the isle. But first, make it around those bay spikes!

> BASE PIKES (1)

Pike rust on the pikes!

> PIE CRUST (1)

Now about that high cup...

> HIKE UP (1)

> W
> W

East done.

> NW

Sore Dark?

> SWORD ARK (1)

The Terra Blade is trapped high above in the arc.

> BLAST RING (1)

Call on the blade.

> TERRIBLE AID (1)

You're kicked back to Ur-Branch, with nothing left to do in the northwest.

> SW

The oak lever has you stumped, until you exclaim Eureka, or...

> OH CLEVER (1)

Now examining the beak makes you faster. Fast enough to earn four turns. You can use them to visit different places.

Looking ahead a bit, the Sign should appear and give everything you've figured out after you go south once. Directions are S, SS and SSS, but you can also use R or RR to rotate between rooms.

The easiest thing to do with the beak is go west. But we'll visit the south first. The south and west are independent.

> X BEAK

> NE

> S

> TOO BROAD (1)

There's an easy point to the south, but it's more efficient to come back later, when you're ready to get the hard one which requires something else.

> N

Ah, a sign appears. It tells you how to get back. And it looks like there are more ways to go south. What if you waste two moves?

> SW

> X BEAK
> NE
> SW
> NE
> S

> HO LANGUOR (1)

You can say langour, too. The difference is semantic. Again, wait to go further south.

> N

So you've been south two ways. Maybe there is a third? But it's tricky ... you need to move around, to find it. And you can't lose *just* one move going back and forth. Is there another option?

> SW

(If you want...)

> X BEAK

The felt wrap can be useful.

> FELL TRAP (1)

> X TRAP

> CELLAR BIN (1)

You lost your speed first time around, but now you can try again.

> U
> X BEAK
> X TRAP
> U
> NE
> S

Okay, you've seen all three near south rooms. To recap, here is how the beak in the fort works to get the locations in the south.

(Tube/Rod) = X BEAK/NE/S e.g. with 3 turns of speed left.
(Sage Oaks) = X BEAK/X TRAP (*after* you've already fallen through)/U/NE/S with 2 turns of speed left.
(Tude Ark) = X BEAK/NE/SW/NE/S e.g. with 1 turn of speed left. You can of course go U/D as well, or other directions. Though I actually cut out X BEAK/X TRAP/U/X TRAP/U/NE/S, because I wanted the player to think a little differently.

> SAY JOKES (1)

> GAS POUCH (1)

We can use R or RR as well, but I'll just use the directional commands.

> N
> N

> SSS

> S

> CLAY MITT (1)

With the pouch, you can now get ...

> DAMP INK (1)

> N
> N
> S
> S

You can now trade with the scribes. They want the ink.

> SCRY BROOM (1)

> N
> N

> SS
> S

And now you can find a lot!

> PRO SWEEPING (1)

> COLD RUM (1)

> TEA LEAVES (1)

The scribes asked you to return the broom. Do so.

> N
> N
> S
> S

> BELT RUSTED (1)

You have everything you need from the south.

> N

> SW
> X BEAK
> NE
> W

The Fort should be closed off now. You've used its speed to open up every entry to the south and west.

You feel frustrated in the Bowl/Ditch.

> BOLD ITCH (1)

> W

You can do something with Turbo Tours, but you don't have to.

@max
> TOUR BOATERS (1)
###skip test checking

You want to go somewhere, but the star craft is too expensive! Anyway, you're not equipped for space flight.

> STARK RAFT (1)

> S

> FIND RINKS (1)

> BERRIES POND (1)

> BARN OPEN (1)

The egg was your main goal here. You're done, and if you try to return, this side area is blocked off. So now let's explore the north branch of the west area.

> N

> E
> N

You're lonely in Sob Acres! You'd like to see someone, anyone.

> SAW BAKERS (1)

Ah, a deli to enter!

> IN

Let's make the surroundings cheerier. Well, less cheerless.

> DELL EASTERN (1)

You need to go out and back in. The fey loaners should consistently tell you, once you do something, to come back later.

> E
> W

Oh, hey! You can finally trade the dough pail!

> DOPE ALE (1)

> E
> W

The new toon has "after" on the right. What are the other two?

Before, during.

What can this become?

> BEEF ORDERING (1)

> E
> W

> WHEAT RYE (1)

> E

You probably got dense pecs some time ago. You could have used them at any time, but it's most dramatic to use them here.

> DEN SPECS (1)

> D

> GROW NODES (1)

There are numbered nodes: node one, node two ... which is vulnerable?

> NO DATE (1)

That's the west cleared! Now you can tackle the northeast completely. Well, you maybe could've midway through the west, but it'd have been inefficient.

> S
> E
> NE

> MALT HOUR (1)

> E

The joy nadir. What can it do to make you happy?

It can combine two items: the pro ball and belt (rusted).

> JOIN AIDER (1)

The surroundings change, and there's a dew pit. You needed more than one of a certain item...

> DUPE IT (1)

...the egg of a guv!

Since you're done in the northeast, you're kicked back to Ur-Branch again.

> U

The throne screams "You! Sit!"

But of course you're not foolish enough.

> USE IT (1)

"It" being, of course, the orb and/or band.

Now the life roots that appeared seem overdone in a different way.

> LIE FRUITS (1)

You have everything you need to entertain the lawyers and your friends! Now, what to do? This is hinted a few places. X has a note at the bottom.

> D

> A STEW (1)

And that's everything! ...or is it?
