Walkthrough for Us Too by Andrew Schultz

The trickiest part so far it seems is getting to the south. Look for south_notes but with a dash not an underscore to explain this.

This is a quick walkthrough for Us Too. It neglects all bonus points.

What is word #1? What is word #2?

That is the mystery which drives the whole game's mechanic.

> HOW SO (1)

Okay, you're wondering why, etc. Am I just being ordered around?

If you look at yourself, you realize you are "Trike" West.

> X ME

You can, at any time, also deal with the lucent row for a bonus point. You can take or leave the eyes and pawn.

> TRY QUEST (2)

Now a beast, wrong, blocks you.

> BE STRONG (3)

Now, if you want, you can start on Item Using and the items it wants.

> I

This creates a useful shortcut.

> X

This will tell you your progress for meaningful items found. You can find one out of the box -- it's the "weird, no instructions" one.

Some munchies ...

> SUMMON CHEESE (4)

Now you can do something with the Lucent Row. It has hint items. But it has something else...

> OUT

At the ur-branch, you need to...

> HERB RANCH (5)

Some herb, eh?

> SUMMER BAY (6)

> E

Now you can have a little rally at Beach, Ill.

> BE CHILL (7)

The nigh swarm.

> NICE WARM (8)

There's a pro ball here, too. It helps you see a bit more.

> PROBE ALL (9)

> W

> D

Ah, a meh spot you missed before.

> MESS POT (10)

> U

Now things open up--there are three exits!

> NE

You can't deal with the tower yet. But the bore dread? Yes.

> BOARD RED (11)

> SW

> N

Oh no! How to avoid black ops? Somewhere else boring?

> BLAH COPSE (12)

This automatically moves you north.

The Forest Team is annoying, with how they knock you verbally.

> NAH QUEUE (13)

Sir Freddie was hiding from them. Questing's not his thing.

> SURF READY (14)

Note if you didn't get the board, you couldn't help him.

Now he said he sensed an orc lurk ...

> OR CLERK (15)

You can go north now.

> N

Morph lairs.

> MORE FLARES (16)

You're back at Ur-Branch.

> N
> N

A row, plaider, has now appeared.

> ROPE LADDER (17)

Okay, that's the north area taken care of. There's a new area, inside, but get by that garden tree...

> GUARD ENTRY (18)

Chance for a bonus point, too.

> PEACE TALKS (19)

> OUT

Let's try the southeast. We can actually take the northwest right now, but the southeast helps with more immediate puzzles.

> SE

A can't-ache blocks you from doing anything else! But once you do, a few things fall.

> CAN TAKE (20)

> GRAY TIN (21)

> DOUGH MAKING (22)

> IN EARNEST (23)

> SE

> IN

> PRY MORE (24)

> OUT

> NW

> E

You've brokered a truce between Sir Freddie and the pun tweaker. Now, ask for payment...

> PUNT WEAKER (25)

> E

There's stuff to be found on the isle. But first, make it around thise bay spikes!

> BASE PIKES (26)

Pike rust on the pikes!

> PIE CRUST (27)

Now about that high cup...

> HIKE UP (28)

> W
> W

East done.

> NW

Sore Dark?

> SWORD ARK (29)

The Terra Blade is trapped in the arc.

> BLAST RING (30)

Call on the blade.

> TERRIBLE AID (31)

That's the northwest down.

> SW

The oak lever has you stumped, until you exclaim Eureka, or...

> OH CLEVER (32)

Now examining the beak makes you faster. Fast enough to earn four turns. You can use them to visit different places.

The Sign should appear and give everything you've figured out after you go south once.

You can do a lot of things with the beak including going west.

> X BEAK

> NE

> S

(If you can't (re-)locate the Tube/Rod, see the end for how to get all 3 places.)

> TOO BROAD (33)

There's an easy point to the south, but it's more efficient to come back later, when you're ready to get the hard one.

> N

Perhaps there are more ways to go south. What if you waste two moves?

> SW

> X BEAK
> NE
> SW
> NE
> S

(If you can't (re-)locate the Tude Ark, see the end for how to get all 3 places.)

> HO LANGUOR (34)

You can say langour, too. The difference is semantic. Again, wait to go further south.

> N

You've been south two ways. Maybe there is a third? But it's tricky ... you need to move around, to find it. And you can't lose just one move going back and forth. Or can you?

> SW

> X BEAK

> FELL TRAP (35)

> X TRAP

> CELLAR BIN (36)

You lost your speed first time around, but now you can try again.

> U
> X BEAK
> X TRAP
> U
> NE
> S

This may be tricky -- you may have found things in a different order than the walkthrough before consulting it.

Here is how the beak/fort work to get the locations in the south.

(Tube/Rod) = X BEAK/NE/S e.g. with 3 turns of speed left.
(Sage Oaks) = X BEAK/X TRAP (*after* you've already fallen through)/U/NE/S with 2 turns of speed left.
(Tude Ark) = X BEAK/NE/SW/NE/S e.g. with 1 turn of speed left. You can of course go U/D as well, or other directions. Though I actually cut out X BEAK/X TRAP/U/X TRAP/U/NE/S, because I wanted the player to think a little differently.

> SAY JOKES (37)

> GAS POUCH (38)

> N
> N

> SSS

> S

> CLAY MITT (39)

With the pouch, you can get ...

> DAMP INK (40)

> N
> N
> S
> S

You can now trade with the scribes. They want the ink.

> SCRY BROOM (41)

> N
> N

> SS
> S

And now you can find a lot!

> PRO SWEEPING (42)

> COLD RUM (43)

> TEA LEAVES (44)

The scribes asked you to return the broom. Do so.

> N
> N
> S
> S

> BELT RUSTED (45)

You should be done now in the south.

> N
> N

> N
> SW
> X BEAK
> NE
> W

You've done what you need in the Fort.

You feel frustrated in the Bowl/Ditch.

> BOLD ITCH (46)

> W

The star craft is too expensive!!

> STARK RAFT (47)

> S

> FIND RINKS (48)

> BERRIES POND (49)

> BARN OPEN (50)

You're done here. Now to the north branch.

> N

> E
> N

You're lonely! You'd like to see someone, anyone.

> SAW BAKERS (51)

Ah, a deli to enter!

> IN

Let's make the surroundings cheerier. Well, less cheerless.

> DELL EASTERN (52)

You need to go out and back in. (I need to clue this better! Have the fey loners whine you can't do anything here.)

> E
> W

You can finally trade the dough pail!

> DOPE ALE (53)

> E
> W

The toon has "after" on the right. What are the other two?

Before, during.

> BEEF ORDERING (54)

> E
> W

> WHEAT RYE (55)

> E

You probably got dense pecs some time ago. Now, time to use them on...

> DEN SPECS (56)

> D

> GROW NODES (57)

There are numbered nodes: node one, node two ... which is vulnerable?

> NO DATE (58)

That's the west cleared! Now you can tackle the northeast completely. Well, you maybe could've midway through the west, but it'd have been inefficient.

> S
> E
> NE

> MALT HOUR (59)

> E

The joy nadir. What can it do for you?

> JOIN AIDER (60)

The dew pit. There's something you need more than one of.

> DUPE IT (61)

...the egg of a guv!

You're kicked back to Ur-Branch again.

> U

The throne screams "You! Sit!"

But of course you're not foolish enough.

> USE IT (62)

It being, of course, the orb and/or band.

The life roots seem overdone in a different way.

> LIE FRUITS (63)

You have everything! Now ...

> D

> A STEW (64)
