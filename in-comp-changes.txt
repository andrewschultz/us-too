--forgot to add Melvin Rangasamy to credits (he found a lot of stuff, and I said oh I'll add him after. Yikes.)
--forgot to place item cuing a certain puzzle in certain room once it was time
--fixed X (main list) bug with extraneous line space
--THINK now has "here" or "in room X" for when you know what to do but didn't have the right items
--eliminated debug code
--you now open the upwards passage in the hub earlier (rule misfire)
--added option to unblock/block areas once done
--added option to make THINK help more detailed e.g. it can show what you've guessed right, not just how much
--also, the first time you have guessed both words right, it says "just" versus "already"
--some good guesses are given more detail and encouragement
--general flavor text upgrades
