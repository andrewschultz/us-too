--forgot to add Melvin Rangasamy to credits (he found a lot of stuff, and I said oh I'll add him after. Yikes.)
--fixed X (main list) bug with extraneous line space
--THINK now has "here" or "in room X" for when you know what to do but didn't have the right items
--eliminated debug code
--you open the passage up in the hub earlier (rule misfire)
--added option to unblock/block areas once done
--added option to make THINK help more detailed e.g. guessing word1 xxx / xxx word2 will now say "word1 word2 is it" if you set an option
--also, when you have guessed both word right, it says "just" versus "already"
